TradeUp: The Smart Trading Journal
TradeUp is not just another trading journal. It's an intelligent partner designed to help crypto traders grow by turning their trading history into actionable insights.

Our mission is to empower traders to move beyond emotional decisions and build data-driven strategies. We achieve this by providing a seamless, intuitive, and powerful tool that analyzes trading habits, identifies patterns, and offers AI-powered coaching.

🎯 Core Concept & Target Audience
The crypto market is full of noise. Most traders fail not because of bad strategies, but because of inconsistent execution and emotional biases. TradeUp is designed to solve this problem.

Core Problem: Traders lack an easy way to record, analyze, and learn from their trades, leading to repeated mistakes.

Our Solution: A mobile-first app that automates trade logging (via API) and provides deep analysis on performance, strategy effectiveness, and psychological patterns.

Target Audience: Primarily young, tech-savvy crypto traders in Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Philippines) who are eager to improve their skills and are comfortable with mobile-first financial tools.

✨ Key Features (MVP & Roadmap)
Phase 1: The Hook (MVP)
The initial version focuses on proving the core value of data-driven journaling, even with manual input.

Manual Trade Logging: An intuitive interface to log complex trades, including partial buys/sells.

Core Analytics Dashboard: Instantly view key metrics like Net P/L, Win Rate, and Profit Factor without overwhelming charts.

Gamified Onboarding: A "Log Your First 10 Trades" challenge to guide new users and deliver an initial "Aha!" moment with a personalized report.

Phase 2: The Upgrade (Partnership Model)
This phase introduces our unique business model, converting users into partners.

API Automation: Connect to major exchanges (like Binance, Bybit) via read-only API keys to automate the entire logging process.

Feature Unlocking: Users who become 'Partners' by signing up with our referral code (new or sub-account) unlock premium features.

Advanced Analytics (Preview): Standard users get a monthly taste of premium features like strategy/psychology analysis and AI coaching.

Phase 3: The Ecosystem (Future)
Transform the app from a tool into a platform.

AI Trading Coach: Personalized advice based on user data compared against anonymized platform-wide statistics (e.g., "Your risk management is in the top 20% of users").

Anonymous Ranking System: Gamified leaderboards for metrics like P/L %, Win Rate, and more to foster healthy competition.

Partner-Only Community: An exclusive community for partners to share insights and grow together.
